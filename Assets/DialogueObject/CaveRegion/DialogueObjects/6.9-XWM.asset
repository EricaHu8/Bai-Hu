  - Oh not to me, Little One. You need to show kindness to other creatures and humans
    whilst you travel towards the East.
  - Help out whoever you can, whenever you can. From that, you'll be able to earn
    your other 8 tails and ascend as a nine-tailed fox.
  - As a gift for saving me, I will grant you your second tail.
